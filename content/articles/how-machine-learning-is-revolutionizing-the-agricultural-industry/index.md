How Machine Learning is Revolutionizing the Agricultural Industry

Agriculture is one of the significant industries globally, which is vital in the sustenance of the world population. With the expected growth of the world population, factors such as food security concerns and climate change have propelled the industry. In enhancing productivity, technology is paramount in ensuring that one can use limited resources to predict, think, and advise farmers in the best ways to achieve food security. [Machine learning](/engineering-education/differences-between-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-and-deep-learning/) is a crucial branch of artificial intelligence that is very promising in enhancing agricultural productivity.

### Why is machine learning meaningful in agriculture?

There are two reasons why machine learning is meaningful in agriculture. One, Machine learning uses a high-precision algorithm, which can make agriculture more effective and efficient. Some of the main machine learning algorithms comprise regression, [artificial neural networks](/engineering-education/introduction-to-neural-networks/), cognitive map learning, and others that could be vital in the agriculture revolution. The algorithms use a data set to make significant inferences which are essential in enhancing agricultural production. The algorithms of machine learning could be used in analysis, predictions, and monitoring.

Secondly, machine learning is accurate and comprehensive. The tool can assess all the various farm parameters that are vital in agricultural production, from detecting and targeting weeds and disease, predicting climate change effects, analyzing the market, and assessing any other activity essential in production. Thus, machine learning could be critical in improving the quality and quantity of agricultural output.

### How does machine learning enhance agricultural revolution?

Machine learning is vital and efficient in enhancing agricultural revolution as discussed below.

#### Pest and disease detection and prediction

Machine learning is one of the technologies termed to be very effective in predicting the presence of disease and pests on a farm. However, there is very minimal information on how machine learning can accurately do it on future pest and disease attacks. One of the critical algorithms used for prediction and detection is [CART](https://machinelearningmastery.com/classification-and-regression-trees-for-machine-learning/) (classification and regression tree).

CART is a vital prediction model in explaining how disease and pests can be detected and predicted using the input values. CART uses a binary tree that inputs the new record to predict pests and diseases. Some of the critical inputs used in detecting and predicting problems include the soil assessment result, moisture, and plant health. The CART clusters need to be well structured to ensure that all the areas in the farm are well considered in the assessment. This ensures that the clusters are used efficiently to accurately detect and predict the diseases and pests on the farm. Thus, based on machine learning, the amount of pesticide and fertilizer to eliminate any pests and diseases in a target area is done.

Machine learning is also vital in pest management. It is essential in the identification of pests even before they occur. Using infrared camera data and intelligent sensor data, machine learning efficiently predicts pest manifestation. The [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/) have proposed machine learning in pest manifestation, but there is no practical use efficiently. However, it has proved to be so promising when the data is efficiently collected from the farm.

#### Monitoring crop fields

Machine learning-based surveillance system is also vital in field management and monitoring in crops. The surveillance system is based on machine learning in sending any alert of anything that may be harming the fields. The surveillance system is vital in reducing any burglary or break-ins and animals that may destroy the crops. The machine-based surveillance system is programmed in such a way that it can identify the employees and any necessary machines that need to be on the farm and signal if there is anything or anyone who may harm the crops. Thus, machine learning is vital in managing large-scale farming, especially those in remote areas.

#### Crop yield optimization

Machine learning is vital in predicting crop yield through visual analytic data and real-time sensor data. The drones and smart sensors are used in capturing data that experts in the agricultural industry analyze to predict production with the use of machine learning. The drawn and smart sensor captures data on fertilizer, moisture, and natural nutrient levels which are vital in assessing the crop's growth pattern and optimizing crop yields.

Machine learning can combine different sets of data and advice on ways to optimize agricultural production. For example, machine learning can combine different algorithms such as regression, CART, and other vital data to provide essential insights to improve crop yields and health.

### Why is machine learning more efficient compared to other technologies in the agricultural revolution?

There are three reasons which could be affiliated to the efficiency of machine learning compared to other technologies. One of the key reasons is its fast processing and real-time prediction ability of machine learning. Machine learning algorithms allow taping into real-time data and burgeoning trends in agriculture within a short time to inform production.

Secondly, machine learning is practical in different scenarios. It can be applied in various areas of agriculture to help in growth and enhance productivity. Thus, machine learning is vital in addressing a scenario engagingly and practically.

Thirdly, machine learning automates repetitive tasks, which saves money and time. Machine learning technology usually cuts on the workload and handles complex data in agricultural production to inform decision-making vital for production. Machine learning can identify cycles and patterns from a large volume of data that other technologies do not quickly. Thus, machine learning is a well-advanced technology that is vital in handling any complex data.

### Conclusion

Machine learning is a crucial branch of AI which could be vital in revolutionizing agriculture. Machine learning uses high-precision algorithms; it is accurate and comprehensive, which is critical in productivity. Machine learning is essential and can be used in various aspects of agriculture, including pest and disease management, monitoring of crop fields, and optimization of crop fields.

Compared to other technologies, machine learning is more efficient in the agricultural revolution due to its ability to automate repetitive tasks, practicability in different scenarios, and real-time and fast processing ability. Therefore, machine learning is a very effective tool that could be used in various areas of agriculture to enhance productivity.

As we can see, machine learning is critical in the agricultural revolution.

Happy Learning!
