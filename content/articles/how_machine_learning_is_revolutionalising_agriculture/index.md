Unsupervised machine learning is another technique used in machine learning in agriculture. The technique entails looking for all unknown data and learning some inherent structures.

Unsupervised techniques common tasks include reduction and clustering. Dimension reduction groups correlated or similar attributes in agriculture for better interpretation. Clustering is useful in grouping the data points of agriculture into clusters. The clustering is vital in assessing the patterns identified from the data points.

### Key machine learning algorithms which the agricultural industry could use?

There are various algorithms of machine learning which the agricultural industry can use. The algorithms categorization is based on the technique adopted in the agricultural sector. The supervised learning algorithms entail CART, decision trees, regression, logistic regression, and KNN. The critical algorithms used in unstructured techniques include K-mean and Apriori algorithms.

### How does machine learning enhance the agricultural revolution?

#### Pest and disease detection and prediction

Machine learning is one of the technologies termed to be very effective in predicting disease and pests on a farm. Yet, there is very minimal information on how machine learning can predict future pest and disease attacks. One of the critical algorithms used for prediction and detection is CART.

CART is a vital prediction model in explaining how disease and pests can be detected and predicted using the input values. CART uses a binary tree that inputs the new record to or shows pests and diseases. Some of the critical inputs used in detecting and predicting include the assessment of soil, moisture, and plant health. The CART clusters need to be well structured to ensure that all the areas in the farm are well considered in the assessment. This ensures that the clusters are used to detect and predict the diseases and pests on the farm. Thus, based on machine learning, the amount of pesticide and fertilizer to eliminate any pests and diseases in a target area is done.

Machine learning is also vital in pest management. It is essential in the identification of pests even before they occur. Machine learning uses infrared camera data and intelligent sensor data to predict pest manifestation. The [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/) is one organization that has proposed machine learning in pest manifestation in Africa and Asia. However, it has proved to be so promising when the data is efficiently collected from the farm.

#### Monitoring crop fields

Machine learning-based surveillance system is also vital in field management and monitoring crops. The surveillance system based on machine learning sends any alert of anything that may harm the fields. The surveillance system is vital in reducing any burglary or break-ins and animals that may destroy the crops. The programming of a machine-based surveillance system ensures that the employees are easily identifiable. The system is also vital in identifying any necessary machines that need to be on the farm and signal anything that may harm the crops. Thus, machine learning is essential in managing large-scale farming, especially those in remote areas.

##### How does this ML surveillance system work?
